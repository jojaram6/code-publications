In this manuscript, I develop a computational framework to study motor planning 
in the mouse. I tackle the important question of why the thalamus is needed to sustain memory activity during a stimulus-absent delay period 
and the manner in which other subcortical structures modulate such activity. To this end, I constructed a mathematical formalism whereby the thalamus 
routes subcortical control signals to affect population activity patterns in the cortex, that I termed dynamical modes. Modulation takes the form of 
amplification, suppression, or de novo generation of modes. Importantly, the formalism is at the ‘right level of description’ to interpret optogenetic 
experiments from my collaborator Karel Svoboda and to generate predictions that can be tested using available data and/or, to encourage new experiments. 
Originally developed for thalamocortical interactions in the context of motor planning, I claim that this ‘mode control’ formalism is applicable to 
non- sensory thalamic nuclei in general and to other cognitive computations.
