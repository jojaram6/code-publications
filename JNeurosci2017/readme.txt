####CODE FOR “Working memory and decision making in a frontoparietal circuit model” J Neurosci 2017. Murray*, Jaramillo*, and Wang. (*co-first authors) The relevant file for working memory computations is 'workingmemoryfigure.py', which calls the script 'functionstwoloop.py' with the main equations.  The key code is in the file 'functionstwoloop.py', in the functions synL1, synL2, synR1, synR2, which are functions that have as outputsi ) the total current for a particular population within a module and ii) the value of the synaptic variable. For example, SynL2 refers to the current arriving at module 2 in population L (in the text, population B). The relevant file for decision making computations is ‘decisioneasy_hard.py’.
